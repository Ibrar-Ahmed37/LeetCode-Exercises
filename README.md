LeetCode Solutions in JavaScript :
This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems written in JavaScript. I created this repository to keep track of my progress and share my solutions with others who might find them helpful.

Organization :
The solutions are organized by problem number. Each problem has its own folder with index.js file that contains the problem description, my thought process, and the code.

Language Used :
All of the solutions are written in JavaScript. I chose JavaScript because it is a widely used programming language that is versatile and can be used for both front-end and back-end development.
